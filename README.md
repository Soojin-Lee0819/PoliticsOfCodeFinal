# Politics of Code Final

**Title**: AI  <br> 
**Author**: Soojin <br> 
**Category**: Final Project <br> 
**Date**: 20 Apr - 2 May 2022 <br> 
**Deliverable**: 1. CSS/HTML/Javascript/API Data Visualization 2. Experiment & Critical Analysis <br>

## Project Brief

Using three APIs that predict the age, the nationality, and the gender of the given name, I developed a web-based data visualization model that visualizes the data associated with names. This project explores the world demographic through the lens of data, such as the 10 most powerful people, or the Interactive Media Faculty of NYUAD. While exploring the different groups of people and their names, we critically examine the AI biases in names and its potential impact. <br>

## Context

AI Machines are increasingly being used to make all kinds of important decisions including who can open a bank account, what kind of health insurance coverage, or the job screenings. AI has many positive benefits, like freeing up our time to do more chllenging tasks or automating our work. However, despite the repeated claim that data-driven approaches are more objective than the past methods with potential biases and errors, AI machines do in fact take after their makers. Most of the AI programs use machine learning, which require data training. While it is true that once the model is trainned, the work can be autonomized without much human intervention, but it is important to realize that these AI machines are trainned with human data and are programmed by huamn. This is why AI systems continue to project historical human biases, and further exacerbate those biases at a much faster rate.


This is why there were AI bias accidents such as  [Google’s facial recognition algorithm labeled black people as gorillas 
](https://www.forbes.com/powerful-people/list/) or more recent [mishap with Amazon’s resume recommendation system] (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-jobs-automation-insight/amazon-scraps-secret-ai-recruiting-tool-that-showed-bias-against-women-idUSKCN1MK08G). 


AI bias is a phenomenon that occurs when an algorithm produces results that are systemically prejudiced due to errornesous assumptions in the machine learning process. AI machines are essentially trained 


Nevertheless, there is an overwhelming amount of real-world examplesof how bias in machine learning algorithsm are discirminating against people and reinforcing injustices in our society. 

On to this complex modern issue, I wanted to explore the __.

Through this  we explore the world demographic through 

It is not only the algorithm machine. Hiring managers too, may make judgments based on conscious or unconscious race or gender bias. 

We are categorized by dataset. 
Elaborating on the game project I created for Connections Lab class, I have made a series of research on visualizing the world through information inferred by data. 

Can names 

A person's name tells a lot about one’s identity. Albeit subconsciously, once we hear names, we immediately associate the names with the name owners' genders, nationalities, and even their ages. For example, my name “Soojin” is a typical Korean female name in Korea that people who are familiar with Korean culture would immediately start making assumptions about me upon introduction. For this project, using two APIs (agify API, nationalize API), that predict the age, and the nationality of the given name, I created a data visualization game. There are two elements to this project. The first is data visualization and the second is gamification. For the data visualization part, when the players type in a name and hit submit, the data about the name (the predicted age and the predicted nationality of the name) will be displayed in the form of bubbles. Based on this data visualization, the game was built. The predicted age will be added to the player's total ‘Age Score’. When the collective Age Score is above 500, the player win! But there’s a catch: if the player enters two names from the same country, the player lose! This game is for people who are culturally conscious, curious about human diversity, or people who live in a diverse community like the community members of NYUAD. Through the process of playing, I hope players have fun finding interesting data about the names around the world but also think critically about the biases and labels that exist in names and identities.

## Part 1: Developing Data Visualization using API



## Part 2: Experiment & Critical Analysis 

Using the data visualization website created above, I visualized the demographics of certain groups including: Interactive Media Faculty at NYUAD, Computer Science Faculty at NYUAD, and the [The World's Most Powerful People](https://www.forbes.com/powerful-people/list/
) by Forbes.
